# LearningAlgorithms
Comparing the greedy algorithm to learning automata. The program implemets 2 learning automata that are known as linear reward-inaction and linear reward-penalty algorithms.

## Results
Comparing the results of the epsilon-greedy algorithm and the learning automata algorithms, the epsilon greedy algorithm
seems to learn better and faster majority of the times for the constants epsilon = 0.1, alpha = 0.1. beta = 0.1. The
average reward collected over time using the epsilon-greedy algorithm is usually higher than the learning automata.
